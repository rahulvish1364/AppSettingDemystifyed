AppSettings.json notes

Appsetting are mainly used to provide static particular for a particular environment/server. In which a app might run in.

This can be thirdparty apps urls, connections strings

May be have same build running on different servers in different part of the world it might different connetions different, Parameters

# Application might get compiled once. Well that's we called a build.
# These same builds are deployed sevral different environments

If we don't use them either we have to embedd all the strings in code which will lead to re-building for every other environment it runs on.
Or we have to mainain a different builds for different environment. 
From maintainbility stand point that's not well suited. 
Infact what we can do is to make different appsettings for different environment or even server running at different places across the globe.  
Example: you might want to use mailing service in your application which might send emails to the users in productions,
But you might need to use them in lower environments / or development or may use them but for testing only.

Well this is not a new concept, .net core is not trying to invent the wheel but trying to re-define the concept.
In .net framework we used use config files which are XML format observe that in student portal
Talking about student portal if you observe we have diifferent URL/connections strings for other teams which run in different environments.
